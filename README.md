== Objective ==
To try and run wallaby as a test runner for my node code. However it always fails with the error message ReferenceError: regeneratorRuntime is not defined
  
I've only seen this error in the browser, so I'm unsure why this problem occurs when I'm trying to run it in the node environment.
